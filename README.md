# POC - Airway Animation

Proof of concept on how to make the airway animation section for the new divisional website.

#### Here is how it should look:

 *Keep in mind you should have access to this in the Figma file.*

### Issue we found:

- Making it with a single image is not enough.
- It is not possible to make it responsive with a single image or even a GIF.
- A Lottie animation would have the same issue cited above.

### Solution:
Make it in CSS / HTML / JS! 

But how? *Good question.* haha

---

I have made a simple HTML file with a wrapper div and a JS file injecting child elements (The airplanes). Feel free to use it as a starting point. Check out the JS file for more info *(It should be quite simple to understand)*.

At this time this I open this place for us to discuss the best way to implement this.
